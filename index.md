Hi! 

I'm an Uruguayan **Machine Learning Engineer** and researcher, in my 30's, passionate about football, photography, and science. In this space, I plan to share some of my work, and also some of my photographs.

With a background in signal processing, I've been working for the last 10+ years in **Machine Vision**, **Image Processing**, and **Machine Learning**. I love both industrial and academic work, and I have always been attracted by applied projects, where I can use the theory to make actual applications, that actually work. 

In 2014 I was awarded a Fellowship to pursue my [Master's degree at Paris Saclay, France](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/academics/mva-master-degree-227777.kjsp?RH=1382710237147){:target="_blank"}, where I graduated with the highest honors. For the internship, I worked in a 3D video-based reconstruction system at Autodesk, France.

I'm currently working in the industry in a Machine Learning studio, [Digital Sense](https://www.digitalsense.ai/){:target="_blank"}, solving Machine Vision problems, and also doing my PhD. in the field of Anomaly Detection in images. I'm especially interested in unsupervised or self-supervised learning, and currently, I'm exploring Bayesian Inference to model data likelihood with Normalizing Flows.
